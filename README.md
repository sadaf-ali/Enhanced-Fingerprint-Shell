# Enhanced-Fingerprint-Shell
The proposed technique transforms a fingerprint template by using a pair of keys defined uniquely for every individual. If the transformed template is compromised, user has an option to generate a new template using a new pair of keys. The proposed technique has been evaluated on IIT Kanpur fingerprint database.
